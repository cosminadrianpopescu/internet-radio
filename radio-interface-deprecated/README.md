This is the initial version of the radio interface (based on `angularjs`). If
you want, you can install this one also, but I would recomand using the new
interface. I will not give any kind of support for this one. 

You also will need to compile the `vlc-server` and install `vlc-nox`, since this
depends on `vlc`, not on `mplayer`.
