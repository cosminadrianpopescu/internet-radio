This is a websocket interface used to communicate from a web browser with a
background `vlc` instance. It was used originally for the `internet-radio`, but
now is deprecated. 

I will not give any kind of support or documentation for this. If anyone is
interested, open a ticked and I will respond there on a case by case basis and
try to help you. 

However, I recommand using the `radio-http`, because it uses only one technology
(`nodejs`) for the `internet-radio`.
